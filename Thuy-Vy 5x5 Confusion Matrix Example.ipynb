able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained and if even the smallest

ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds he told the bbc news website the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much con ##jo ##ined the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master he says but currently putting master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high definition films demand as much as you com ##press the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explains would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high def world and find it very exciting high definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high definition dvds in months time mr dean is confident though think if they see real hd high definition not some heavily compressed version of it there is such remarkable difference have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen high definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too on the whole producing films for high definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd when we master movies right now our data rates are running at about gig ##abi ##ts

you have anything that allows more space you don have to com ##press so hard studios could fit lot more marketing material games and features onto high capacity dvds currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months says mr dean although the step of down converting will be bypassed this will realistic ##ally only save day work says mr dean one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems on the fairly complex star wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took human hours alone if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content thinks mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it those costs could filter down to the price ticket on high definition dvd but if the consumer is not willing to pay premium price studios will listen thinks mr dean high definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production

blurred enough during the pan that you just didn see it what high definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur with home theatre

economic stability the lowest mortgage ##s inflation unemployment for decades and the key investment in public services believe that the tory plans are as plain call to return to the past as it possible to imagine he said it a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in years of conservative government mr blair added they the

tori ##es would make cuts such as removing regional assemblies but would bring in more police officers and match labour spending on health and education everybody knows having lived through this
